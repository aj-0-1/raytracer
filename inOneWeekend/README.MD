A raytracer is a computer graphics technique that simulates the behavior of light to create highly realistic images.

Scene Setup:
Define the scene with objects, light sources, camera position, and viewing plane.

Ray Generation:
For each pixel in the output image, cast a ray from the camera through that pixel into the scene.

Ray-Object Intersection:
Calculate if and where the ray intersects with objects in the scene.
Find the closest intersection point for each ray.

Shading and Lighting:
At the intersection point, calculate the color based on:
Material properties of the object
Light sources in the scene
Shadows (by casting rays to light sources)

Reflection and Refraction:
If the object is reflective or transparent, generate secondary rays:
Reflection rays to simulate mirror-like surfaces
Refraction rays for transparent materials like glass

Recursive Ray Tracing:
Repeat steps 3-5 for secondary rays, up to a defined recursion depth.

Color Accumulation:
Combine the colors from all interactions to determine the final pixel color.

Image Output:
After processing all pixels, output the resulting image.
This process creates highly realistic images by simulating light behavior, including effects like shadows, reflections, and refractions.
